A few weeks ago the Total Open Station repository saw a burst of activity, when one blocking issue was finally solved, and that allowed me and the other contributors to release in a short cycle the long awaited 0.6 version, followed by the 0.7 version.

Version 0.6 is almost entirely the work of @psolyca, who added full support for LandXML as both input and output format. The subset of LandXML that is supported is specifically targeted to survey data and we are looking forward to seeing reports from users in the field. There are many applications that are compatible with LandXML. During the 0.6 release cycle, the project adopted a code of conduct, the creation of a Windows portable app (click-and-run, even from a USB stick) was automated, as the continuous testing of the code.

Version 0.7 is a much simpler story. We switched to the new standard pyproject.toml configuration file for the project metadata, ensuring a cleaner development environment, and we added a variant of the existing CSV output format that is compatible with the LandSurveyCodesImport plugin for QGIS.

Speaking of QGIS, our contributor Enzo Cocca has created a beautiful plugin for using Total Open Station inside QGIS, with a dedicated interface for the same underlying functionality. For our next release, we have planned to bring some changes and new features that were added in the plugin repository, and align the version that is used (currently 0.5.3).

We will be happy to hear your reports and accept your contributions to the development of the software.
