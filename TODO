Once fast_download() has been implemented, use a ProgressBar to inform the
user that we are performing the download operation.

Below the progress bar (which will be presumably doing ping-pong because we
cannot tell the amount of downloaded data until we have it all) should be
italicized text with the current task:

* waiting data from device
* downloading data
* elaborating data

In another sense, we could consider this process a 3-step one and provide such
a progress bar that reflects this situation. An interesting option could be a
checklist window:

    Occasionally a procedure is comprised of a series of user performable
    actions. In these cases, particularly when it is desirable that the user
    acquire some familiarity with the actions involved in a procedure,
    checklist windows may be used.

A "Cancel" button is mandatory.
