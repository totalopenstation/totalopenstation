=====================
 Getting sample data
=====================

Even when your device is not listed among the supported ones, Total
Open Station can still be useful, particularly for:

1. finding the right **serial connection parameters** from an unknown
   device. You can play with the 8 options and see the results in a
   text area. Once the downloaded results look good, you can be almost
   sure that you have used the right parameters, and we can add the
   tested model parameters to the program database;
2. retrieving **sample data** from unknown models and submit them to
   allow support of those models in future releases of the program.

To do this, you can just use the main Total Open Station
executable.

.. warning::

   Remember: Total Open Station is no wizard, and you have to tune the
   serial port options using your prior knowledge of your total
   station (e.g. read the manual that came with it, look at other
   programs' options).
