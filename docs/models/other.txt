Other models
============

Unimplemented :term:`models <model>` can be added to TotalOpenStation.

The best way to have your model included in the next version of
TotalOpenStation is to file a support request in the bug tracker and attach
some sample data dumps obtained with the Helper application.

If you can write Python code, you can also write a module by yourself using
the existing ones as a guide. Should you write a module, we will be happy to
receive it and include it in the TotalOpenStation source tree.

    participate actively to the development.
