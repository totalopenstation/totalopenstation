 Installing
============

There are a few different ways to install Total Open Station,
depending on your operating system. If you are on GNU/Linux or Mac
OSX, you should already have Python installed on your
system. Instructions for Microsoft Windows are below.

Using ``pip`` (recommended)
===========================

Until your operating system's packaging tools (e.g. ``apt`` or
``yum``) allow you to install Total Open Station along with other
programs, the recommended way to install is using ``pip``_ (a package
manager for Python) and ``virtualenv``_ (which creates isolated
software environments: basically you don't mix packages installed
system-wise with your package manager and user-installed
software). Here follows a detailed step-by-step guide.

.. _``virtualenv``: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv

Install ``pip`` and ``virtualenv``
----------------------------------

First of all, make sure you have ``pip`` and ``virtualenv``
installed. All major GNU/Linux distributions have them packaged:

- Debian and derivatives (including Ubuntu): ``apt-get install
  python-pip python-virtualenv``
- Fedora: ``yum install python-pip python-virtualenv``

Create a virtual environment
----------------------------

Creating a virtual environment is as easy as typing in a terminal::

    virtualenv tops-environment

A new directory named ``tops-environment`` was created. It contains a
minimal set of files needed to manage a Python installation that is
isolated from the one installed on your system, helping to keep things
clean.

Now activate the environment with::

    source tops-environment/bin/activate

From now on, all Python-related actions will be executed within the
newly created environment, and not on the system-wide
installation. You terminal should look a bit different when the
virtual environment is active::

    (tops-environment)steko@gibreel:$

You can change directory freely, the environment will remain active.

You *deactivate* the environment (that is, you exit from it), with the
``deactivate`` command.

Installing Total Open Station
-----------------------------

Once the virtual environment is active, you're ready to install Total
Open Station, with::

    pip install totalopenstation

This will automatically download the latest released version from the
Python Package Index (PyPI), and install all the other required Python
packages as well.

Running the program
-------------------

When the program is installed, you can use it from the command line or
with a graphical interface (recommended for new users).

From your terminal, type::

    totalopenstation-gui.py

and the program should start. Please report any errors to the `mailing
list`_

The next time you want to run the program, follow these steps:

#. open a terminal
#. ``cd`` to the directory where the virtual environment was created
#. ``source tops-environment/bin/activate`` to enter the virtualenv
#. ``totalopenstation-gui.py`` will start the program

Windows
=======

There is a binary installer available at PyPI_. This requires you to
install a Python_ distribution (latest available is 2.7.1 â€’ do not
install Python 3 as we don't support it yet), and the pyserial_ and
setuptools_ modules.
