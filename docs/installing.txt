 Installing
============

There are a few different ways to install Total Open Station,
depending on your operating system. If you are on GNU/Linux or Mac
OSX, you should already have Python installed on your
system.

Instructions for Microsoft Windows are at the end of this page.

Using ``pip``
=============

Until your operating system's packaging tools (e.g. ``apt`` or
``yum``) allow you to install Total Open Station along with other
programs, the recommended way to install is using ``pip``, like::

  pip install totalopenstation

This will install all the other required Python packages as
well. ``pip`` is complementary with virtualenv_, and it is encouraged
that you use virtualenv to isolate your installation::

  pip -E tops install totalopenstation

where ``-E tops`` creates a virtual environment named ``tops`` and
installs totalopenstation into it.

.. _virtualenv: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv

Read more about ``pip`` at http://pip.openplans.org/ and
http://guide.python-distribute.org/pip.html .

Manual install with ``setup.py``
================================

If you manually download the source distribution file from PyPI or
from the mercurial repository, first make sure you have installed all
the :ref:`required packages <requirements>`. Then, just ``cd`` into
the uncompressed directory and::

  python setup.py install

Again, it's strongly recommended to avoid a system-wide install. Use
``virtualenv``.

Microsoft Windows
=================

Three packages need to be installed before the actual installation of
Total Open Station, because the program is written in the Python
programming language which is not installed by default on Windows.

.. warning::

   You might need administrator privileges to be able to install all
   the programs.

Install Python
--------------

Check whether your Windows is 32 bit (common) or 64 bit. Then download
the right Python installer (direct link to the installation download):

- `32-bit Python installer`_
- `64-bit Python installer`_

When you've got the installer donwloaded on your computer, install
it. You don’t need to use Python directly, but it is needed for the
program to work.

.. _`32-bit Python installer`: http://python.org/ftp/python/2.7.2/python-2.7.2.msi
.. _`64-bit Python installer`: http://python.org/ftp/python/2.7.2/python-2.7.2.amd64.msi

Install PythonWin
-----------------

Download PythonWin_ from and install it. Again, you don’t
need to use it directly, but it is needed for the program to work.

.. _PythonWin: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build216/pywin32-216.win32-py2.7.exe/download

Install pySerial
----------------

Download pySerial_ and install it. As with PythonWin, you don’t need
to use it directly, but it is needed for the program to work. Do NOT
install pySerial 2.5 because it doesn’t work correctly on Windows.

.. _pySerial: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyserial/files/pyserial/2.4/pyserial-2.4.win32.exe/download


Install Total Open Station
--------------------------

Download the most recent version of `Total Open Station`_ and install it.
You will find the totalopenstation-gui script in C:/Python27/Scripts/
unless you have changed the standard installation options (not
recommended). You can create a shortcut to the program on your desktop
if you like.

To upgrade to a newer version, just go to
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/totalopenstation, download the latest
version and install it as with the first one. The old version will get
overwritten. No data will be lost!

Install the Prolific PL2032 drivers
-----------------------------------

(optional, but recommended).

Most USB-serial adapters are made with the Prolific chipset. If
plugging the cable gives you errors about missing drivers for your
hardware, drivers for Windows can be downloaded from the `Prolific
website`_.
