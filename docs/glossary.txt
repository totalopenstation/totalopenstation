    input format
    	An input format is the way data downloaded from the total
	station are encoded. This might include a default order for X,
	Y and Z coordinates, particular ways of prefixing each point
	with some distinctive text string and other features. Each
	input format is unique, and it requires a dedicated
	module. Input formats are not readable by common CAD or GIS
	software packages, and it is TOPS's work to export them. These
    	formats have a standard name, either given by the manufacturer
    	or by the TOPS development team.

    model
        When we refer to a *model* we mean all total stations that
        have the same brand name and manufacturer (e.g. all those
        labeled “Trimble Geodimeter 600”).

    output format
        A format readable by GIS, CAD or any sort of common software,
        like CSV or DXF.

    serial-USB adapter
        While most total stations have a serial interface (port and cable),
        modern PCs and laptops tend to have just USB ports. In such cases, it
        is possible to use a serial-USB adapter cable, that enables you to
        connect the total station to one of your USB ports. Depending on your
        platform, the device might be identified as ``/dev/ttyUSB0`` or
        ``COM5``.
