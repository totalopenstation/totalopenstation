====================================
 Doing a Total Open Station release
====================================

Translations
============

When the release is almost ready and the source strings are not going
to change, translators should be invited to submit updates, either via
``.po`` files or Transifex_.

.. _Transifex: https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/totalopenstation/resource/totalopenstation-app/

When the translation period is over, pull the updated ``.po`` files
from Transifex with::

      tx pull -r totalopenstation.totalopenstation-app -a

and check that the files are updated. Commit new files separately from updates.
